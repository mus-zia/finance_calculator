## Installation
To install and use the Financial Calculator, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can clone the repository or download the source code. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the source code is located, and run the Python script.

## Usage
After installing the Financial Calculator, you can start the application by running the Python script. The application will prompt you to choose between the "Bond" or "Investment" calculator.  

For the "Bond" calculator, you will be asked to enter the current value of the house, the current annual interest rate, and the number of months to repay the bond. The application will then calculate and display your monthly repayment.

For the "Investment" calculator, you will need to enter the amount you are depositing, the interest rate, the number of years you will be investing, and whether the interest is 'simple' or 'compound'. The application will then calculate and display the future value of your investment.
